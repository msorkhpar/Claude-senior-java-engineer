## Introduction

Operators in Java are symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands and then return a result.
Understanding these operators is crucial for writing efficient and correct Java code. This guide covers arithmetic,
relational, and logical operators, their usage, and best practices.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric operands.

| Operator | Description         | Example    |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| +        | Addition            | a + b      |
| -        | Subtraction         | a - b      |
| *        | Multiplication      | a * b      |
| /        | Division            | a / b      |
| %        | Modulus (remainder) | a % b      |
| ++       | Increment           | ++a or a++ |
| --       | Decrement           | --a or a-- |

### Key Points:

- The `/` operator performs integer division when both operands are integers.
- The `%` operator works with floating-point numbers as well as integers.
- Increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators can be used as prefix or postfix.

## Relational Operators

Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean result.

| Operator | Description              | Example |
|----------|--------------------------|---------|
| ==       | Equal to                 | a == b  |
| !=       | Not equal to             | a != b  |
| >        | Greater than             | a > b   |
| <        | Less than                | a < b   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | a >= b  |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | a <= b  |

### Key Points:

- These operators return `true` or `false`.
- Be cautious when comparing floating-point numbers due to precision issues.
- For object comparison, use `equals()` method instead of `==`.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators perform boolean logic operations.

| Operator | Description | Example  |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| &&       | Logical AND | a && b   |
| \|\|     | Logical OR  | a \|\| b |
| !        | Logical NOT | !a       |
| &        | Bitwise AND | a & b    |
| \|       | Bitwise OR  | a \| b   |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR | a ^ b    |

### Key Points:

- `&&` and `||` use short-circuit evaluation.
- `&` and `|` evaluate both operands regardless of the first operand's value.
- The `^` operator returns `true` if the operands are different.

## Key Points to Remember

1. Operator precedence: Arithmetic > Relational > Logical
2. Use parentheses to clarify complex expressions.
3. Be aware of integer overflow and underflow.
4. Short-circuit evaluation can improve performance and prevent errors.
5. Floating-point arithmetic may lead to precision errors.

## Java 21 Features and Modern Practices

1. Use `Math.floorDiv()` and `Math.floorMod()` for consistent behavior with negative numbers.
2. Consider using `java.util.concurrent.atomic` classes for thread-safe increment/decrement operations.
3. Use `Double.compare()` or `Float.compare()` for comparing floating-point numbers.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

1. Using `==` to compare objects instead of `equals()`.
2. Integer division truncation: Use casting or floating-point division when needed.
3. Unintended side effects with increment/decrement operators in complex expressions.
4. Ignoring operator precedence, leading to unexpected results.

## Best Practices and Optimization Techniques

1. Use compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) for readability and slight performance improvement.
2. Prefer `&&` and `||` over `&` and `|` for boolean operations to leverage short-circuit evaluation.
3. Use bitwise operators for performance-critical low-level operations.
4. Consider using `BigDecimal` for precise decimal calculations, especially in financial applications.

## Edge Cases and Their Handling

1. Division by zero: Use exception handling or check for zero before division.
2. Overflow/Underflow: Use `Math.addExact()`, `Math.multiplyExact()`, etc., for checked arithmetic.
3. NaN and Infinity: Be aware of special floating-point values and handle them appropriately.
4. Comparing NaN: Use `Double.isNaN()` or `Float.isNaN()` instead of relational operators.

## Interview-specific Insights

Common interview questions:

1. Explain the difference between `++i` and `i++`.
2. How does short-circuit evaluation work in logical operators?
3. What's the difference between `&` and `&&`, or `|` and `||`?
4. How would you handle potential integer overflow in Java?
5. Explain the behavior of the modulus operator with negative numbers.

When answering these questions, focus on:

- Clear explanations with examples
- Mentioning potential pitfalls and best practices
- Discussing performance implications where relevant
